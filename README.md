# Linear-Models-in-ML
This repo Implements [Linear Regression](https://github.com/vamc-stash/Linear-Models-in-ML/tree/master/LinearRegression), [Ridge regression](https://github.com/vamc-stash/Linear-Models-in-ML/tree/master/RidgeRegression), [Lasso Regression](https://github.com/vamc-stash/Linear-Models-in-ML/tree/master/LassoRegression), [Polynomial regression](https://github.com/vamc-stash/Linear-Models-in-ML/tree/master/PolynomialRegression) and  [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/vamc-stash/Linear-Models-in-ML/tree/master/LogisticRegression) models from scratch in Python.

Please read this [blog](https://medium.com/@rangavamsi5/linear-regression-models-in-machine-learning-e8e20bf3a974) which talks about linear, ridge and lasso regressions and this [blog](https://medium.com/@rangavamsi5/logistic-regression-6d2ee14de50e) for Logistic Regression.
